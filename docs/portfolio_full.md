## 1. Executive Summary

**EduLens AI** is a structured AI teaching assistant I designed and built as part of the **Leo Suite** — a three-app EdTech portfolio covering student wellbeing (YouthMentor), teaching intelligence (EduLens), and robotics simulation (CampusBot).

EduLens addresses a concrete classroom pain point: teachers spend large amounts of time marking homework and preparing differentiated materials, while students often receive only a final score without structured feedback on *why* they made mistakes or *what* to practise next.

My solution is not a generic chatbot. EduLens returns **validated, structured JSON** — marking-style feedback, mistake type classification, similar practice questions, syllabus-aware lesson plans, worksheets, visual learning animations, and exportable PDF/DOCX/PPTX reports. The system is built on **Next.js 16**, uses a **multi-provider LLM chain** with automatic mock fallback for reliable demos, and includes a **RAG-lite syllabus layer** aligned to Singapore MOE curriculum topics.

The application is deployed live on Vercel and documented in a public showcase repository. Full source code, API routes, and prompt templates remain in a **private deployment repository** to protect intellectual property and API configuration — a deliberate portfolio strategy recommended for DSA submissions involving production AI systems.

**Key metrics of the build:**

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Tech stack | Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Zod |
| Codebase (private) | ~90 library modules under `src/lib/edulens/` |
| API routes | 9 server endpoints for homework, lessons, dashboard, OCR |
| AI providers | Agnes, Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Mock |
| Export formats | PDF, DOCX, PPTX, animated lesson export |
| Data storage | Browser `localStorage` (no server database in MVP) |
| Tests | Unit tests for prompt builder, JSON parser, visual type detection, RAG retrieval |

---

## 2. Background & Problem Statement

### 2.1 The marking bottleneck

In secondary school mathematics and science, a single worksheet may contain 8–15 questions. A teacher marking 35 students can spend 2–4 hours on one assignment. Even when marking is complete, written feedback is often brief — a tick, a cross, or a single-line comment — because time is limited.

Students, meanwhile, need more than a score. Research on formative assessment consistently shows that **timely, specific feedback** on error patterns improves retention and reduces repeated mistakes. Yet most AI homework tools today either:

- Give free-form chat replies that are hard to compare across students, or
- Return a single "correct answer" without rubric-style breakdown, or
- Require expensive enterprise LMS integration inaccessible to individual students.

### 2.2 Why structured output matters

Large language models are strong at natural language but weak at consistency unless constrained. For an educational product, inconsistent output formats break downstream features: mistake books, dashboards, printable reports, and teacher review workflows all depend on **predictable data shapes**.

EduLens was designed around this principle: every AI response passes through a **Zod schema validator** before reaching the UI. If parsing fails, the system retries or falls back to the next provider — or to seeded mock data in demo mode.

### 2.3 My motivation

As a student building for DSA-JC Computing, I wanted to demonstrate:

1. **Full-stack engineering** — not just prompting ChatGPT, but building API routes, validation, export pipelines, and deployment.
2. **Responsible AI** — disclaimers, teacher-review flags, and demo mode that works without leaking API keys.
3. **Real-world product thinking** — freemium tiers, syllabus alignment, and a sibling app (YouthMentor) with hard safety guardrails.

EduLens sits in the "AI for Smarter Schools" theme: augmenting teachers, not replacing them.

---

## 3. Target Users & Use Cases

### 3.1 Primary personas

| Persona | Need | How EduLens helps |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| **Secondary student (13–18)** | Understand mistakes after homework | Structured feedback, mistake book, similar questions |
| **Teacher / tutor** | Draft lesson materials faster | Lesson generator with syllabus RAG, PDF/DOCX export |
| **Parent** | Monitor learning patterns (future) | Dashboard stats from local history |
| **School IT / reviewer (DSA)** | Evaluate AI EdTech safely | Mock mode demo, public docs, no source leak |

### 3.2 Representative use cases

**Use case A — Homework photo upload**

A student photographs a completed math worksheet. EduLens runs vision OCR (when real AI is enabled), splits the text into questions, retrieves relevant syllabus chunks, and returns per-question scores, mistake types (`conceptual`, `calculation`, `careless`, `incomplete`, `method`), and improvement tips.

**Use case B — Lesson preparation**

A teacher enters "Quadratic equations — factorisation" with grade level O-Level. EduLens generates a lesson pack: objectives, worked examples, worksheet questions, assessment alignment, and optional visual animation steps (parabola graph, factor pairs, etc.).

**Use case C — Mistake pattern review**

After several analyses, the mistake book aggregates recurring error types. The student exports a PDF report for parent-teacher conference or self-study.

**Use case D — Portfolio demo (no API key)**

A reviewer opens the Vercel URL. Demo mode returns high-quality seeded analyses — no external API call, no cost, no key exposure.

## 4. Product Vision & Design Goals

### 4.1 Vision statement

> *Make structured, syllabus-aware AI feedback accessible to every student — with teachers always in the loop.*

### 4.2 Design principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Structure over chat** | JSON schemas for all AI outputs |
| **Teacher in the loop** | `teacherReviewRecommended` flag on analyses |
| **Demo reliability** | Mock mode with bilingual seeded content |
| **Provider resilience** | Chain: try provider A → B → C → mock |
| **Privacy by default** | No accounts, no server DB in MVP |
| **Syllabus alignment** | Indexed MOE topic catalog + PDF chunks |
| **Export-ready** | PDF, Word, PowerPoint pipelines |

### 4.3 What EduLens is NOT

- Not an official exam board or MOE-endorsed marking system
- Not automated plagiarism detection
- Not a replacement for teacher professional judgment
- Not real-time classroom proctoring

These boundaries are stated in-app and in the public safety design document.

---

## 5. Core Features (Detailed)

### 5.1 Homework Analyzer (`/edulens/homework-analyzer`)

**Input modes:**

- Paste text (questions + student answers)
- Upload image(s) — processed through vision OCR pipeline

**Output structure (validated JSON):**

```
HomeworkAnalysis
├── result (overall assessment text)
├── estimatedScore / rubricAnalysis
├── mistakeTypes[] (tagged categories)
├── mistakeBreakdown[] (per-error detail)
├── feedback[] (per-question cards)
├── similarQuestions / remedialQuestions / extensionQuestions
├── learningVisualLessons[] (optional animated steps)
├── learningPlan (structured next steps)
├── teacherReviewRecommended (boolean)
└── knowledgePoints[] (syllabus-linked)
```

**Sample type excerpt (public showcase repo):**

The showcase repository includes a non-sensitive type definition in `sample/homework-result-types.ts` showing the shape reviewers can expect — without exposing Zod schemas or prompts.

### 5.2 Lesson Generator (`/edulens/lesson-generator`)

Generates a **lesson pack** containing:

- Lesson plan (objectives, timing, differentiation)
- Worksheet with graded difficulty
- Visual learning steps with LaTeX support
- Concept maps for writing / humanities topics
- Assessment alignment checks against syllabus expectations

**Multi-part generation:** Long lessons are fetched in parts to respect token limits, then merged and enriched (media, visuals, assessment alignment).

**Export options:**

| Format | Library / approach |
|--------|-------------------|
| PDF | jsPDF with math rendering |
| DOCX | Structured document builder |
| PPTX | Slide generation from lesson steps |
| Animation | Step-by-step visual export |

### 5.3 Mistake Book (`/edulens/mistake-book`)

Persists analysis history in browser `localStorage`. Groups entries by mistake type and knowledge point. Enables students to see patterns ("3 calculation errors on quadratics this week") rather than isolated scores.

### 5.4 Dashboard (`/edulens/dashboard`)

Aggregates usage stats: analyses run, common mistake types, recent activity. API route `/api/edulens/dashboard` serves computed stats from the in-memory / local store.

### 5.5 Reports (`/edulens/reports/[id]`)

Printable report view for a single analysis — suitable for sharing with teachers or parents.

### 5.6 AI Status (`/api/edulens/ai-status`)

Public endpoint showing active provider, mode (mock/auto), and configuration health — useful for demo verification without exposing secrets.

## 7. AI System Design

### 7.1 Provider chain

EduLens abstracts LLM providers behind a unified `completeJSON()` interface. Environment variables control mode:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `EDULENS_AI_MODE` | `mock` \| `auto` \| single provider |
| `EDULENS_DEV_PROFILE` | Development profile (agnes-free, gemini-free, mock) |
| `EDULENS_PROVIDER_CHAIN` | Ordered fallback list |
| `EDULENS_SKIP_OLLAMA` | Required on Vercel (no local Ollama) |

**Production demo (Vercel default):** `mock` mode — zero API cost, deterministic seeded responses.

**Real AI (local or post-review):** `auto` mode with API keys stored only in Vercel / `.env.local` (never committed).

### 7.2 Structured JSON pipeline

```
User input
  → Build prompt (with RAG context)
  → LLM completion
  → Extract JSON from response (json-parser)
  → Zod validate
  → applySafetyDefaults()
  → Enrich (visual lessons, media, assessment alignment)
  → Return to UI
```

If validation fails: retry with compact prompt → try next provider → throw typed error (`HomeworkAnalysisError` with codes: `no_ai_provider`, `ai_failed`, `validation_failed`).

### 7.3 Vision OCR

Image uploads flow through `extractFromImages()` in the vision module. Supports multi-image homework pages. OCR text is combined with user metadata before analysis prompt construction.

### 7.4 Prompt design (summary — details private)

Prompts are modular:

- `buildHomeworkAnalysisPrompt` / `Compact` variant for token limits
- `buildLessonPackPrompt` / `Compact`
- `buildMistakeClassificationPrompt`
- `buildSimilarQuestionsPrompt`
- `buildLearningPlanPrompt`

Compact variants activate when context window is constrained. Full templates remain in the private repository.

### 7.5 Mock / demo layer

The demo module provides bilingual seeded responses (`seed-en.ts`, `seed-zh.ts`) and topic-specific lesson mocks (quadratic, calculus, generic). Mock mode is not a stub — it returns pedagogically realistic content suitable for DSA portfolio review.

---

## 8. RAG & Syllabus Integration

### 8.1 Why RAG for education

Generic LLMs may hallucinate curriculum scope (e.g., teaching calculus techniques not in O-Level syllabus). EduLens indexes **Singapore syllabus topics** and PDF chunks to ground generation.

### 8.2 Knowledge sources

| Source | File / module | Use |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Topic catalog | `sg-syllabus-topics.json` (+ extensions) | Dropdown options, topic labels |
| PDF chunks | `sg-syllabus-pdf-chunks.json` | Retrieved paragraphs for prompts |
| Web knowledge | `fetch-wikipedia-knowledge.ts` | Optional; disabled on Vercel demo |
| Concept labels | `syllabus-concept-labels.ts` | Localized topic names |

### 8.3 Retrieval flow

```
Topic + subject + grade
  → retrieve-topic-knowledge.ts (keyword + catalog match)
  → retrieve-lesson-rag.ts (chunk budget scaling)
  → compact-rag-prompt.ts (fit within token budget)
  → Appended to lesson/homework prompt
```

**Budget scaling:** Larger-context models receive more chunks; compact models get truncated RAG summaries.

### 8.4 Syllabus options API

`/api/edulens/syllabus-options` exposes safe metadata for UI dropdowns — subjects, grades, topics — without exposing raw PDF content.

---

## 9. Visual Lesson Engine

### 9.1 Purpose

Static text explanations are insufficient for STEM topics. EduLens generates **visual learning steps** — animated scenes for parabolas, integrals, chemistry reactions, pH titration curves, speed-rate graphs, writing structure outlines, and more.

### 9.2 Visual type detection

The module `detect-visual-type.ts` maps lesson step content to animation types:

| Visual type | Example topic |
|-------------|---------------|
| `parabola_graph` | Quadratic functions |
| `integral_area` | Definite integrals |
| `factor_pairs` | Factorisation |
| `chemistry_reaction` | Reaction diagrams |
| `ph_titration` | Acid-base titration |
| `writing_structure` | Essay / email format |
| `mistake_compare` | Common error contrast |
| `formula_spotlight` | Key formula display |

**Latest improvement (June 2026):** AI-assigned `visualType` values are now **validated against step content** before acceptance. If the model assigns `integral_area` to a geometry arc-length problem, the system overrides via keyword detection — preventing misleading animations.

### 9.3 Enrichment pipeline

```
Raw lesson JSON from LLM
  → sanitize-lesson-content.ts
  → lesson-normalizer.ts
  → build-lesson-visual-lessons.ts
  → enrich-lesson-visual-lessons.ts (detect visual types)
  → enrich-lesson-media.ts (optional imagery)
  → align-lesson-assessment.ts
```

---

## 10. Quality, Safety & Privacy

### 10.1 AI marking disclaimer

EduLens provides **draft** marking-style feedback. The UI displays that AI analysis may contain errors and recommends teacher review. The `teacherReviewRecommended` field is set by validation defaults when confidence is low or content is ambiguous.

### 10.2 Content safety

| Area | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Generated lessons | Flagged for teacher review before classroom use |
| Homework feedback | Structured JSON with explicit mistake categories |
| OCR images | Processed transiently; not stored on server |
| Syllabus RAG | Local indexed content in MVP |

### 10.3 Data handling

| Data | Where stored | Server DB |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| Homework text | Transient API call to LLM | No |
| Analysis results | Browser localStorage + in-memory store | No |
| User accounts | Not implemented | No |

### 10.4 Demo mode safety

Mock mode ensures portfolio reviewers can test all flows without:

- Exposing API keys in network requests
- Incurring token costs
- Depending on third-party uptime

## 14. Reflection & Future Work

### 14.1 What I learned

1. **Constraining LLMs with schemas** is harder than prompting but essential for product features downstream.
2. **Demo reliability** matters as much as model quality — mock mode saved multiple portfolio presentations.
3. **Validating AI metadata** (e.g., visual types) prevents embarrassing UX bugs in STEM animations.
4. **Private/public repo split** balances DSA proof with IP protection.

### 14.2 Limitations (honest assessment)

- No server-side user accounts — history is device-bound
- AI marking accuracy varies by subject; teacher review remains necessary
- RAG corpus is Singapore-focused; other curricula need re-indexing
- Real-time collaboration (teacher class dashboard) is planned but not built

### 14.3 Future roadmap

| Phase | Feature |
|-------|---------|
| Phase 2 | Teacher classroom dashboard (B2B pilot) |
| Phase 3 | LMS integration (Google Classroom / Schoology) |
| Phase 4 | Fine-tuned marking rubrics per school |
| Phase 5 | Parent portal with consent-based sharing |
